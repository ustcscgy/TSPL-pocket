<h2>The Scheme Programming Language, 4th Edition</h2>
<h3>Written by R. Kent Dybvig</h3>
<h4>Illustrations by Jean-Pierre H&eacute;bert</h4>

<h3>From the back cover</h3>

<p>
Scheme is a general-purpose programming language, descended from Algol and
Lisp, widely used in computing education and research and a broad range of
industrial applications.  This thoroughly updated edition of <i>The Scheme
Programming Language</i> provides an introduction to Scheme and a
definitive reference for standard Scheme, presented in a clear and concise
manner.  Written for professionals and students with some prior
programming experience, it begins by leading the programmer gently through
the basics of Scheme and continues with an introduction to some of the
more advanced features of the language.
</p>

<p>
The fourth edition has been substantially revised and expanded to bring
the content up to date with the current Scheme standard, the
Revised<sup>6</sup> Report on Scheme.  All parts of the book were updated
and three new chapters were added, covering the language's new library,
exception handling, and record-definition features.
</p>

<p>
The book offers three chapters of introductory material with numerous
examples, eight chapters of reference material, and one chapter of
extended examples and additional exercises.  All of the examples can be
entered directly from the keyboard into an interactive Scheme session. 
Answers to many of the exercises, a complete formal syntax of Scheme, and
a summary of forms and procedures are provided in appendixes.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Scheme Programming Language</i> is the only book available that
serves both as an introductory text in a variety of courses and as an
essential reference for Scheme programmers.

<p>
"Kent Dybvig's <i>The Scheme Programming Language</i> is to Scheme what
Kernighan and Ritchie's <i>The C Programming Language</i> is to C.  Kent's
book is the book for either the novice or serious Scheme programmer.  Its
style, wit, and organization has reached a new high with the publication
of the fourth edition."<br>
&mdash;<b>Daniel P. Friedman</b>, Department of Computer Science, Indiana
University
</p>

<p>
"Students in my Programming Language Concepts class need to learn the
basics of Scheme in a few days, and to pick up harder concepts throughout
the course. 
For 19 years, <i>The Scheme Programming Language</i> has been an excellent
guide for them. 
Dybvig's rapid-fire prose and examples serve both the Scheme beginner and
the experienced programmer in need of a reference. 
Seldom do my students make a point of praising a computer science
textbook; that happens over and over with this one."<br>
&mdash;<b>Claude W. Anderson</b>, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology
</p>

<p>
"Eric Raymond once wrote that learning Lisp makes one a better programmer
for the rest of one's days.  Scheme is the best dialect of Lisp to learn
for this purpose, and Kent Dybvig's book provides a comprehensive and
beautiful introduction to learning Scheme and becoming a better
programmer."<br>

Computation</i>
